1. Java provides the mathematical methods sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, toRadians,
toDegree, exp, log, log10, pow, sqrt, cell, floor, rint, round, min, max,
abs, and random in the Math class for performing mathematical functions.
2. The character type char represents a single character.

3. An escape sequence consists of a backslash (\) followed by a character or a combina-
tion of digits.

4. The character \ is called the escape character.
5. The characters ' ', \t, \f, \r, and \n are known as the whitespace characters.
6. Characters can be compared based on their Unicode using the relational operators.
7. The Character class contains the methods isDigit, isLetter, isLetterOrDigit, isLowerCase, isUpperCase for testing whether a character is a digit, letter, lower- case, and uppercase. It also contains the toLowerCase and toUpperCase methods for returning a lowercase or uppercase letter.
8. A string is a sequence of characters. A string value is enclosed in matching double quotes ("). A character value is enclosed in matching single quotes (').
9. Strings are objects in Java. A method that can only be invoked from a specific object is called an instance method. A non-instance method is called a static method, which can be invoked without using an object.

10. You can get the length of a string by invoking its length() method, retrieve a char-
acter at the specified index in the string using the charAt(index) method, and use the indexOf and lastIndexOf methods to find a character or a substring in a string.
11. You can use the concat method to concatenate two strings, or the plus (+) operator to
concatenate two or more strings.
12. You can use the substring method to obtain a substring from the string.
13. You can use the equals and compareTo methods to compare strings. The equals method returns true if two strings are equal, and false if they are not equal. The compareTo method returns 0, a positive integer, or a negative integer, depending on
whether one string is equal to, greater than, or less than the other string.
14. The printf method can be used to display a formatted output using format specifiers.
