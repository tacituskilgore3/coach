1. The procedural paradigm focuses on designing methods. The object-oriented paradigm
couples data and methods together into objects. Software design using the object-
oriented paradigm focuses on objects and operations on objects. The object-oriented
approach combines the power of the procedural paradigm with an added dimension that
integrates data with operations into objects.
2. Many Java methods require the use of objects as arguments. Java offers a convenient
way to incorporate, or wrap, a primitive data type into an object (e.g., wrapping int into
the Integer class, and wrapping double into the Double class).
3. Java can automatically convert a primitive type value to its corresponding wrapper
object in the context and vice versa.
4. The BigInteger class is useful for computing and processing integers of any size. The
BigDecimal class can be used to compute and process floating-point numbers with any
arbitrary precision.
5. A String object is immutable; its contents cannot be changed. To improve efficiency
and save memory, the JVM stores two literal strings that have the same character
sequence in a unique object. This unique object is called an interned string object.
6. A regular expression (abbreviated regex) is a string that describes a pattern for match-
ing a set of strings. You can match, replace, or split a string by specifying a pattern.
7. The StringBuilder and StringBuffer classes can be used to replace the String
class. The String object is immutable, but you can add, insert, or append new contents
into StringBuilder and StringBuffer objects. Use String if the string contents
do not require any change, and use StringBuilder or StringBuffer if they might
change.
